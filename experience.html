        <h1>School</h1>
        <h2>University of Michigan</h2>
        <p>I'm currently a sophomore at <a href="https://umich.edu/">University of Michigan.</a> I'm studying <a href="https://cse.engin.umich.edu/">Computer Science</a> but planning to transfer to <a href="https://www.si.umich.edu/">School of Information</a> next year.</p>
        <h2>University of Tokyo</h2>
        <p>Before I came to University of Michigan, I went to <a href="https://www.u-tokyo.ac.jp/en/index.html">University of Tokyo</a> for 3 months. I was on the science course but I quit since I wanted to study in the States. </p>
        <h2>Musashi High School</h2>
        <p>I went to <a href="https://www.musashi.ed.jp/language/english.html">Musashi High School</a> in Japan. I was on the science track.</p>

        <h1>Experience</h1>
        <h2>Ibis Paint</h2>
        <p>I worked at <a href="https://ibispaint.com/?lang=en-US">Ibis Paint</a> last summer. It was a great experience and I learned a lot about both technical skills and what was like to be a full-time software enginner.</p>
        <p>They make a painting app not only for desktops and labtops but also for smartphones and tables. It is great and <a href="https://ibispaint.com/product.jsp">you should definitely check it out!</a> especially if you like drawing. It's free!</p>
        <h2>Game Development</h2>
        <p>I've been working on creating a tic tac toe like game, which my friends and I divised when we were in high school. It is an advanced tic tac toe. I'm planning to refine it this summer (During the semesters, I'm busy with class works). If I'm satisfied with it, I might publish it. Stay tuned!</p>
